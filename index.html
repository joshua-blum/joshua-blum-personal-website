        <h3>About Me
        </h3>
        <p>After graduating from UCLA, I went into the medical field as an ophthalmic technician. While providing care for patients, I realized one of the things that can make or break patient care is the efficacy of the medical record software. Having taken computer science courses before, I am looking to expand my skillset to be able to not only build clean and effective user interfaces for medical professionals, but also to help patients as the navigate their healthcare online.<p>
        <p>As a student at <a href = "https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/"><strong>Thinkful</strong></a>, I'm grateful that I'm being equipped with more skills to be able to apply to help people in their day to day lives. I'm excited to work with other developers to be able to help people virtually!</p> 
        <p>Outside of software engineering, I enjoy photography, visiting new places, and learning more about the world around me. Sometimes it just takes a change of context to see the world in a whole new light.<p>
